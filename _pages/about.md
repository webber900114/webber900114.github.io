I am Wei-Bo Kao, and I will soon begin my DPhil studies in astrophysics at the University of Oxford, supervised by Prof. Julien Devriendt and Prof. Adrianne Slyz. My main research interests focus on using numerical simulations to investigate the evolution and formation of active galactic nuclei (AGN), supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and galaxies.

Before coming to Oxford, I completed my master’s degree in physics at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Lucio Mayer. I earned my bachelor’s degree in astronomy at Peking University, where I explored many fields in astrophysics, including theoretical astrophysics, observations, and data science.

I am from Taiwan, and my Mandarin name is 高瑋伯. Please also feel free to call me Webber. Beyond astrophysics, I have a passion for food, music, baseball, and a wide variety of sports. Welcome to contact me through my email: wei-bo.kao@physics.ox.ac.uk
